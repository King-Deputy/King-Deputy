The resulting code can be simpler to understand and maintain since components can be considered in isolation. In Python, **modularization** is implemented using functions, modules and packages.\n","\n","A **module** is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes, variables and runnable code. These modules can be imported and referenced from other python code. A **python package** (also referred to as a library) is a collection of hierarchically structured directories of python code consisting of sub-packages and modules.\n","\n","Modules and packages are two mechanisms that facilitate modular programming.\n","\n","## Why modularization?\n","\n","* **Reusability**: Eliminates the need to write new code, as functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused.\n","\n","\n","* **Simplicity**: Modules generally tend to focus on a selected area of the problem which is usually small, rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand. Integrating the use of selected modules will result in you systematically dealing with each small problem in your code making development easier and less error-prone.\n","\n","\n","* **Maintainability**: Modules in Python are often designed to be self-supporting. In this sense, one module does not depend entirely upon other modules to work. Therefore it is unlikely that modifying a single module of a program will affect other parts of the program. This allows a team of many programmers or data scientists to work collaboratively on a large application."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29a02336","metadata":{"id":"29a02336"},"source":["We can access this module and its elements from a different python file by using the `import` statement.\n","* We can import a single module/package:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    import <module_name>\n","    ```\n","\n","* import multiple modules using individual import statements:\n","\n","    ```python\n","    import <module_1_name>\n","    import <module_2_name>\n","    import <module_3_name>\n","    ...```\n","    \n","    \n","                      \n","The same rules apply when dealing with packages.
