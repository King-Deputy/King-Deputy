Numpy and Pandas are two commonly used and useful ones. In this train, you will learn some of the basic operations in Numpy and Pandas.\n","\n","# Numpy\n","Numpy is a Python package which provides high-performance, multidimensional array objects, numerical computing tools, and is fundamental in scientific computing. It is the core library for scientific computing in Python ([see the full documentation](https://numpy.org/)). We will start by defining what an array is, how to create an array, how to access and modify an array, and look at useful functions on arrays. Finally, we will identify when an array should be the chosen data structure when performing data analysis or manipulation.\n","\n","### What is an Array?\n","Similar to that of a Python list, a numpy array is a data structure which stores multiple values. The main difference between the two is that lists can contain heterogeneous data types (combinations of `str`, `int`, even `list`), whilst numpy arrays can only store values of the same data type. Numpy arrays can be thought of as a grid of values and can be multi-dimensional.\n","\n","Numpy arrays are stored more efficiently than Python lists and allow mathematical operations to be vectorized, which results in significantly higher performance than with looping constructs in Python.\n","\n","### Creating a Numpy Array\n","If we want to work with any numpy objects or functions we first need to import the Numpy library.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"id":"xdSYVbt3k81x"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"s0zfywkdk813"},"source":["To make a numpy array, you use the `np.array()` function.
